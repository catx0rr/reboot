# reboot.py


## A simple, automated reboot script for routers on telnet protocol.

- Disclaimer:
	- This was made for personal use, since some ISP routers enables telnet for cli management (IDK why they use telnet, SSH is under their control)
	- You may use the script as you like and modify it for your own use.
